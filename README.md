# Flex Edge

This is a very flexible rules-lite role playing game which uses a d6 dice pool and skills. 
While simple, it is easy to bend to many genres and settings.

This bare bones system provides enough for an experienced GM to run a game. It provides a 
strong foundagion for making rulings instead of providing rules for every possible scenario.

Bring your setting, a pile of d6 and your imagination.
